abstract = {In a world designed for legs, quadrupeds, bipeds, and humanoids have the opportunity to impact emerging robotics applications from logistics, to agriculture, to home assistance. The goal of this survey is to cover the recent progress toward these applications that have been driven by model-based optimization for the real-time generation and control of movement. The majority of the research community has converged on the idea of generating locomotion control laws by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) in either a model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the most general of these problems online remains intractable due to complexities from intermittent unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees of freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to make these OCPs computationally tractable, with a specific focus on how environmental contacts are treated, how the model can be simplified, and how these choices affect the numerical solution methods employed. The survey focuses on model-based optimization while paving its way for broader combination with learning-based formulations to accelerate progress in this growing field.},

The monopod can jump in any direction and the terrain underneath its foot can be uneven. This is a template of a much larger class of problems, which are extremely challenging and computationally expensive to solve using standard optimisation-based techniques. Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be an interesting alternative, but the application of an end-to-end approach in which the controller must learn everything from scratch, is impractical. The solution advocated in this paper is to guide the learning process within an RL framework by injecting physical knowledge. This expedient brings to widespread benefits, such as a drastic reduction of the learning time, and the ability to learn and compensate for possible errors in the low-level controller executing the motion. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach with respect to both optimization-based and end-to-end RL approaches.},

The long-term vision to drive the design of dynamic and efficient robots by means of computational techniques is applied to improve the development of a new quadruped prototype. The scale of the robot and its actuators are optimized for energy efficiency considering a complete model of the motor, that includes friction, torque, and bandwidth limitations. This model is used to optimize the power consumption during bounding and backflip tasks and is validated by tracking the output trajectories on the first prototype iteration. The co-design results show an improvement of up to 87\% for a single task optimization. It appears that, for jumping forward, robots with longer thighs perform better, while for backflips, longer shanks are better suited. To understand the trade-off between these different choices, a Pareto set is constructed to guide the design of the next prototype.},

abstract = {In recent years, advanced model-based and data-driven control methods are unlocking the potential of complex robotics systems, and we can expect this trend to continue at an exponential rate in the near future. However, ensuring safety with these advanced control methods remains a challenge. A well-known tool to make controllers (either Model Predictive Controllers or Reinforcement Learning policies) safe, is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). Unfortunately, for nonlinear systems, such a set cannot be exactly computed in general. Numerical algorithms exist for computing approximate control-invariant sets, but classic theoretic control methods break down if the set is not exact. This paper presents our recent efforts to address this issue. We present a novel Model Predictive Control scheme that can guarantee recursive feasibility and/or safety under weaker assumptions than classic methods. In particular, recursive feasibility is guaranteed by making the safe-set constraint move backward over the horizon, and assuming that such set satisfies a condition that is weaker than control invariance. Safety is instead guaranteed under an even weaker assumption on the safe set, triggering a safe task-abortion strategy whenever a risk of constraint violation is detected. We evaluated our approach on a simulated robot manipulator, empirically demonstrating that it leads to less constraint violations than state-of-the-art approaches, while retaining reasonable performance in terms of tracking cost and number of completed tasks.},

These coordinates enjoy desirable linear flow dynamics and rather elegant jump dynamics perturbed by a suitable extended class ${\mathcal K}_\infty$ function of the position error. We stabilize this hybrid error dynamics using a saturated feedback controller, selecting its gains by solving a convex optimization problem. We prove local asymptotic stability of the tracking error and provide a certified estimate of the basin of attraction, comparing it with a numerical estimate obtained from the integration of the closed-loop dynamics.

This paper presents a versatile and reliable gait pattern generator for these devices able to accommodate several gait requirements, i.e., step length, clearance, and time, and to suit a wide range of persons. In the proposed method, the human gait phases have been modeled with a set of trajectories as B{\`{e}}zier curves, enabling a robotic lower-limb exoskeleton to walk in a continuous way, similarly to the physiological gait cycle. The kinematic, kinetic, and spatial requirements for each gait phase are translated into the control points of the B{\`{e}}zier curves that define the trajectory for that phase. The outcome of this study has been tested on real scenarios with a group of healthy subjects wearing the TWIN lower-limb exoskeleton. They were asked to walk at different speeds, generally defined as slow, medium, and fast. The results are shown in terms of joint positions, velocities, and body-mass-normalized torques. The maximum hip and knee joint torque was observed in the support phase. While, at higher speeds the maximum hip torque was provided in the swing phase due to the mechanical properties and limits of the device. In terms of speed, all the subjects reached 0.44 m/s, which is the minimum required community ambulation.},

abstract = {Quadruped robots are machines intended for challenging and harsh environments. Despite the progress in locomotion strategy, safely recovering from unexpected falls or planned drops is still an open problem. It is further made more difficult when high horizontal velocities are involved. In this letter, we propose an optimization-based reactive Landing Controller that uses only proprioceptive measures for torque-controlled quadruped robots that free-fall on a flat horizontal ground, knowing neither the distance to the landing surface nor the flight time. Based on an estimate of the Center of Mass horizontal velocity, the method uses the Variable Height Springy Inverted Pendulum model for continuously recomputing the feet position while the robot is falling. In this way, the quadruped is ready to attain a successful landing in all directions, even in the presence of significant horizontal velocities. The method is demonstrated to dramatically enlarge the region of horizontal velocities that can be dealt with by a naive approach that keeps the feet still during the airborne stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a quadruped robot can successfully recover from falls with horizontal velocities up to 3m/s in simulation. Experiments prove that the used platform, Go1, can successfully attain a stable standing configuration from falls with various horizontal velocities and different angular perturbations.},

abstract = {Rescue missions in mountain environments are hardly achievable by standard legged robots - because of the high slopes - or by flying robots - because of limited payload capacity. We present a concept for a rope-aided climbing robot which can negotiate up-to-vertical slopes and carry heavy payloads. The robot is attached to the mountain through a rope, and it is equipped with a leg to push against the mountain and initiate jumping maneuvers. Between jumps, a hoist is used to wind/unwind the rope to move vertically and affect the lateral motion. This simple (yet effective) two-fold actuation allows the system to achieve high safety and energy efficiency. Indeed, the rope prevents the robot from falling while compensating for most of its weight, drastically reducing the effort required by the leg actuator. We also present an optimal control strategy to generate point-to-point trajectories overcoming an obstacle. We achieve fast computation time (<1 s) thanks to the use of a custom simplified robot model. We validated the generated optimal movements in Gazebo simulations with a complete robot model with a < 5\% error on a 16m long jump, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and confirming the interest of our concept. Finally, we performed a reachability analysis showing that the region of achievable targets is strongly affected by the friction properties of the foot-wall contact.},

abstract = {Safety is often the most important requirement in robotics applications. Nonetheless, control techniques that can provide safety guarantees are still extremely rare for nonlinear systems, such as robot manipulators. A well-known tool to ensure safety is the Viability kernel, which is the largest set of states from which safety can be ensured. Unfortunately, computing such a set for a nonlinear system is extremely challenging in general. Several numerical algorithms for approximating it have been proposed in the literature, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a new approach for numerically approximating the viability kernel of robot manipulators. Our approach solves optimal control problems to compute states that are guaranteed to be on the boundary of the set. This allows us to learn directly the set boundary, therefore learning in a smaller dimensional space. Compared to the state of the art on systems up to dimension 6, our algorithm resulted to be more than 2 times as accurate for the same computation time, or 6 times as fast to reach the same accuracy.},

abstract = {This letter presents a novel algorithm for the continuous control of dynamical systems that combines Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a single framework. The motivations behind this algorithm are the two main limitations of TO and RL when applied to continuous nonlinear systems to minimize a non-convex cost function. Specifically, TO can get stuck in poor local minima when the search is not initialized close to a 'good' minimum. On the other hand, when dealing with continuous state and control spaces, the RL training process may be excessively long and strongly dependent on the exploration strategy. Thus, our algorithm learns a 'good' control policy via TO-guided RL policy search that, when used as initial guess provider for TO, makes the trajectory optimization process less prone to converge to poor local optima. Our method is validated on several reaching problems featuring non-convex obstacle avoidance with different dynamical systems, including a car model with 6D state, and a 3-joint planar manipulator. Our results show the great capabilities of CACTO in escaping local minima, while being more computationally efficient than the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL algorithms.},

abstract = {For legged robots, aerial motions are the only option to overpass obstacles that cannot be circumvented with standard locomotion gaits. In these cases, the robot must perform a leap to either jump onto the obstacle or fly over it. However, these movements represent a challenge, because, during the flight phase, the Center of Mass (CoM) cannot be controlled, and there is limited controllability over the orientation of the robot. This paper focuses on the latter issue and proposes an Orientation Control System (OCS), consisting of two rotating and actuated masses (flywheels or reaction wheels), to gain control authority on the orientation of the robot. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the rotational velocity if the robot can be adjusted to steer the robot's orientation, even when the robot has no contact with the ground. The axes of rotation of the flywheels are designed to be incident, leading to a compact orientation control system that is capable of controlling both roll and pitch angles, considering the different moments of inertia in the two directions. The concept was tested by means of simulations on the robot Solo12.},

We consider a system subject to bounded additive disturbances on the control inputs, with constant joint position, velocity and acceleration bounds. We compute the robust viability kernel, which is the set of states such that, starting from any such state, it is possible to avoid violating the constraints in the future, despite the presence of disturbances. Then we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the range of feasible accelerations that allow the state to remain inside the robust viability kernel. Our derivation ensures the continuous-time robust satisfaction of the joint bounds, while considering the discrete-time nature of the control inputs.

In this work, we propose to use stochastic trajectory optimization for generating robust centroidal momentum trajectories to account for additive uncertainties on the model dynamics and parametric uncertainties on contact locations. Through an alternation between the robust centroidal and whole-body trajectory optimizations, we generate robust momentum trajectories while being consistent with the whole-body dynamics.

We suggest to tackle this issue by using exponential integrators, a long-standing class of integration schemes (first introduced in the 1960s) that in recent years has enjoyed a resurgence of interest. This scheme can be applied to multibody systems subject to stiff viscoelastic contacts, leading to integration errors similar to implicit Euler, but at much lower computational costs (between 2 to 100 times faster). In our tests with quadruped and biped robots, our method demonstrated a stable behavior with large time steps (10 ms) and stiff contacts (10 5 N/m).

To address these issues, we propose a modified version of a standard MPC approach used in legged locomotion with viability (weak forward invariance) guarantees. In this approach, instead of adding a (conservative) terminal constraint to the problem, we propose to use the measured state projected to the viability kernel in the OCP solved at each control cycle. Moreover, we use past experimental data to find the best cost weights, which measure a combination of performance, constraint satisfaction robustness, or stability (invariance). These interpretable costs measure the tradeoff between robustness and performance. For this purpose, we use Bayesian optimization to systematically design experiments that help efficiently collect data to learn a cost function leading to robust performance. Our simulation results with different realistic disturbances (i.e., external pushes, unmodeled actuator dynamics, and computational delay) show the effectiveness of our approach to create robust controllers for humanoid robots.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new framework for the computational design of robots that are robust to disturbances. The framework combines trajectory optimization (TO) and feedback control design to produce robots with improved performance under perturbations by co-optimizing a nominal trajectory alongside a feedback policy and the system morphology. Stochastic programming (SP) methods are used to address these perturbations via uncertainty models in the problem specification, resulting in motions that are easier to stabilize via feedback. Two robotic systems serve to demonstrate the potential of the method: a planar manipulator and a jumping monopod robot. The co-optimized robots achieve higher performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions where the feedback controller is designed separately from the physical system. Specifically, the co-designed controllers show higher tracking accuracy and improved energy efficiency (e.g., 91% decrease in tracking error and ≈5% decrease in energy consumption for a manipulator) compared to linear quadratic regulator applied to a design optimized for nominal conditions.},

abstract = {One challenge of legged locomotion on uneven terrains is to deal with both the discrete problem of selecting a contact surface for each footstep and the continuous problem of placing each footstep on the selected surface. Consequently, footstep planning can be addressed with a Mixed Integer Program (MIP), an elegant but computationally demanding method, which can make it unsuitable for online planning. We reformulate the MIP into a cardinality problem, then approximate it as a computationally efficient ell 1-norm minimisation, called SL1M. Moreover, we improve the performance and convergence of SL1M by combining it with a sampling-based root trajectory planner to prune irrelevant surface candidates. Our tests on the humanoid Talos in four representative scenarios show that SL1M always converges faster than MIP. For scenarios when the combinatorial complexity is small (< 10 surfaces per step), SL1M converges at least two times faster than MIP with no need for pruning. In more complex cases, SL1M converges up to 100 times faster than MIP with the help of pruning. Moreover, pruning can also improve the MIP computation time. The versatility of the framework is shown with additional tests on the quadruped robot ANYmal.},

This paper presents two novel approaches to control a legged robot balancing on visco-elastic contacts, and compares them to other two state-of-the-art methods. Our simulation results show that performance heavily depends on the contact stiffness and the noises/uncertainties introduced in the simulation. Briefly, the two novel controllers performed best for soft/medium contacts, whereas “inverse-dynamics control under rigid-contact assumptions” was the best one for stiff contacts. Admittance control was instead the most robust, but suffered in terms of performance. These results shed light on this challenging problem, while pointing out interesting directions for future investigation.},

In this paper, we propose for the first time to use linear stochastic MPC (SMPC) to account for uncertainties in bipedal walking. We show that SMPC offers more flexibility to the user (or a high level decision maker) by tolerating small (user-defined) probabilities of constraint violation. Therefore, SMPC can be tuned to achieve a constraint satisfaction probability that is arbitrarily close to 100%, but without sacrificing performance as much as tube-based RMPC. We compare SMPC against RMPC in terms of robustness (constraint satisfaction) and performance (optimality). Our results highlight the benefits of SMPC and its interest for the robotics community as a powerful mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties.},

abstract = {Versatility is one of the main factors driving the adoption of robots on the assembly line and in other applications. Compared to fixed-automation solutions, a single industrial robot can perform a wide range of tasks (e.g., welding, lifting). In other platforms, such as legged robots, versatility is a necessity to negotiate varied terrains. The ability to balance performance across these anticipated scenarios is one of the main challenges to the process of design. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a new framework for the computational design of versatile robots by considering the interplay between mechanical design and control across multiple tasks and environments. The proposed method optimizes morphology parameters while simultaneously adjusting control parameters using trajectory optimization (TO) so that a single design can fulfill multiple tasks. As its main contribution, the letter details an approach to combine methods from stochastic programming (SP) with TO to address the scalability of these multi-task co-design problems. To assess the effects of this contribution, this letter considers the problems of designing a planar manipulator to transport a range of loads and a hopping monopod robot that must jump across a variety of terrains. The proposed formulation achieves faster solution times and improved scalability in comparison to state of the art co-design solutions. The resulting designs are also shown to be more versatile in terms of providing improved energy cost and task completion times across multiple scenarios.},

Recent contributions propose to use integer variables to represent which contact surface is selected, and then to rely on modern mixed-integer (MI) optimization solvers to handle this combinatorial issue. To reduce the computational cost of MI, we exploit the sparsity properties of L1 norm minimization techniques to relax the contact planning problem into a feasibility linear program. Our approach accounts for kinematic reachability of the center of mass (COM) and of the contact effectors. We ensure the existence of a quasi-static COM trajectory by restricting our plan to quasi-flat contacts. For planning 10 steps with less than 10 potential contact surfaces for each phase, our approach is 50 to 100 times faster that its MI counterpart, which suggests potential applications for online contact re-planning.

abstract = {Trajectory optimization (TO) is one of the most powerful tools for generating feasible motions for humanoid robots. However, including uncertainties and stochasticity in the TO problem to generate robust motions can easily lead to intractable problems. Furthermore, since the models used in TO have always some level of abstraction, it can be hard to find a realistic set of uncertainties in the model space. In this paper we leverage a sample-efficient learning technique (Bayesian optimization) to robustify TO for humanoid locomotion. The main idea is to use data from full-body simulations to make the TO stage robust by tuning the cost weights. To this end, we split the TO problem into two phases. The first phase solves a convex optimization problem for generating center of mass (CoM) trajectories based on simplified linear dynamics. The second stage employs iterative Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) as a whole-body controller to generate full body control inputs. Then we use Bayesian optimization to find the cost weights to use in the first stage that yields robust performance in the simulation/experiment, in the presence of different disturbance/uncertainties. The results show that the proposed approach is able to generate robust motions for different sets of disturbances and uncertainties.},

abstract = {Predictive control is an efficient model-based methodology to control complex dynamical systems. In general, it boils down to the resolution at each control cycle of a large nonlinear optimization problem. A critical issue is then to provide a good guess to initialize the nonlinear solver so as to speed up convergence. This is particularly important when disturbances or changes in the environment prevent the use of the trajectory computed at the previous control cycle as initial guess. In this paper, we introduce an original and very efficient solution to automatically build this initial guess. We propose to rely on off-line computation to build an approximation of the optimal trajectories, that can be used on-line to initialize the predictive controller. To that end, we combined the use of sampling-based planning, policy learning with generic representations (such as neural networks), and direct optimal control. We first propose an algorithm to simultaneously build a kinodynamic probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and approximate value function and control policy. This algorithm quickly converges toward an approximation of the optimal state-control trajectories (along with an optimal PRM). Then, we propose two methods to store the optimal trajectories and use them to initialize the predictive controller. We experimentally show that directly storing the state-control trajectories leads the predictive controller to quickly converges (2 to 5 iterations) toward the (global) optimal solution. The results are validated in simulation with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and other dynamical systems.},

abstract = {We present a framework capable of producing contact plans describing complex multiped motions (including humanoid): standing up, climbing stairs using a handrail, crossing rubble and getting out of a car. Our framework answers a need demonstrated at the Darpa Robotics Challenge, where the lack of an automatic acyclic contact planner was recognized a major issue. Our novel key idea is the reachability condition. Informally, it verifies that the root configuration of a robot is “close, but not too close” from obstacles: close to allow contact creation, not too close to avoid collision. With this approximation of the space of admissible root configurations we decompose the hard contact planning problem into simpler sub-problems: first, to plan a guide path for the root without considering the whole-body configuration; then, to generate a discrete sequence of whole-body configurations in static equilibrium along this path. The reachability condition turns the high-dimensional computation of the guide into a collision checking problem, solved in less than a few seconds. Then a deterministic contact selection algorithm tackles the combinatorial issue of generating of a discrete sequence along the guide path. Several innovations make it computationally efficient: a criterion for verifying static equilibrium, and a set of heuristics used to enforce desirable properties on the configuration. Our approach results from the pragmatic choice of favoring efficiency over exhaustiveness, justified empirically: in a few seconds, with satisfying success rates, we generate complex contact plans for various scenarios and robots, namely HRP-2, HyQ, and a dexterous hand.},

abstract = {Recently, the centroidal momentum dynamics has received substantial attention to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in multi-contact scenarios. However, it is also non convex which renders any optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate how timing optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with fixed timing.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. Multi contact motions synthesized by our method. Synthesizing motions for legged characters in arbitrary environments is a long-standing problem that has recently received a lot of attention from the computer graphics community. We tackle this problem with a procedural approach that is generic, fully automatic and independent from motion capture data. The main contribution of this paper is a point-mass-model-based method to synthesize Center Of Mass trajectories. These trajectories are then used to generate the whole-body motion of the character. The use of a point mass model often results in physically inconsistent motions and joint limit violations. We mitigate these issues through the use of a novel formulation of the kinematic constraints which allows us to generate a quasi-static Center Of Mass trajectory, in a way that is both user-friendly and computationally efficient. We also show that the quasi-static constraint can be relaxed to generate motions usable for applications of computer graphics (on average 83% of a given trajectory remain physically consistent). Our method was integrated in our open-source contact planner and tested with different scenarios -some never addressed before-featuring legged characters performing non-gaited motions in cluttered environments. The computational efficiency of our trajectory generation algorithm (under ten ms to compute one second of motion) enables us to synthesize motions in a few seconds, one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The ability to anticipate a fall is fundamental for any robot that has to balance. Currently, fast fall-prediction algorithms only exist for simple models, such as the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), whose validity breaks down in multi-contact scenarios (i.e. when contacts are not limited to a flat ground). This paper presents a fast fall-prediction algorithm based on the point-mass model, which remains valid in multi-contact scenarios. The key assumption of our algorithm is that, in order to come to a stop without changing its contacts, a robot only needs to accelerate its center of mass in the direction opposite to its velocity. This assumption allows us to predict the fall by means of a convex optimal control problem, which we solve with a fast custom algorithm (less than 10 ms of computation time). We validated the approach through extensive simulations with the humanoid robot HRP-2 in randomly-sampled scenarios. Comparisons with standard LIPM-based methods demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in predicting the fall of the robot, when controlled with a state-of-the-art balance controller. This work lays the foundations for the solution of the challenging problem of push recovery in multi-contact scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates a family of new simple estimators to reconstruct the pose and velocity of the floating base. The estimation of the floating-base state is a critical challenge to whole-body control methods that rely on full-state information in high-rate feedback. Although the kinematics of grounded limbs may be used to estimate the pose and velocity of the body, modelling errors from ground irregularity, foot slip, and structural flexibilities limit the utility of estimation from kinematics alone. These difficulties have motivated the development of sensor fusion methods to augment body-mounted IMUs with kinematic measurements. Existing methods often rely on extended Kalman filtering, which lack convergence guarantees and may present difficulties in tuning. This paper proposes two new simplifications to the floating-base state estimation problem that make use of robust off-the-shelf orientation estimators to bootstrap development. Experiments for in-place balance and walking with the HRP-2 show that the simplifications yield results on par with the accuracy reported in the literature for other methods. As further benefits, the structure of the proposed estimators prevents divergence of the estimates, simplifies tuning, and admits efficient computation. These benefits are envisioned to help accelerate the development of baseline estimators in future humanoids.},
