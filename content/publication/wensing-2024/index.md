abstract: In a world designed for legs, quadrupeds, bipeds, and humanoids have the
  opportunity to impact emerging robotics applications from logistics, to agriculture,
  to home assistance. The goal of this survey is to cover the recent progress toward
  these applications that have been driven by model-based optimization for the real-time
  generation and control of movement. The majority of the research community has converged
  on the idea of generating locomotion control laws by solving an optimal control
  problem (OCP) in either a model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the
  most general of these problems online remains intractable due to complexities from
  intermittent unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees
  of freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to
  make these OCPs computationally tractable, with a specific focus on how environmental
  contacts are treated, how the model can be simplified, and how these choices affect
  the numerical solution methods employed. The survey focuses on model-based optimization
  while paving its way for broader combination with learning-based formulations to
  accelerate progress in this growing field.
