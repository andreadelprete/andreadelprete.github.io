abstract: 'This article proposes a new framework for the computational design of robots
  that are robust to disturbances. The framework combines trajectory optimization
  (TO) and feedback control design to produce robots with improved performance under
  perturbations by co-optimizing a nominal trajectory alongside a feedback policy
  and the system morphology. Stochastic programming (SP) methods are used to address
  these perturbations via uncertainty models in the problem specification, resulting
  in motions that are easier to stabilize via feedback. Two robotic systems serve
  to demonstrate the potential of the method: a planar manipulator and a jumping monopod
  robot. The co-optimized robots achieve higher performance compared to state-of-the-art
  solutions where the feedback controller is designed separately from the physical
  system. Specifically, the co-designed controllers show higher tracking accuracy
  and improved energy efficiency (e.g., 91% decrease in tracking error and â‰ˆ5% decrease
  in energy consumption for a manipulator) compared to linear quadratic regulator
  applied to a design optimized for nominal conditions.'
