abstract: Fig. 1. Multi contact motions synthesized by our method. Synthesizing motions
  for legged characters in arbitrary environments is a long-standing problem that
  has recently received a lot of attention from the computer graphics community. We
  tackle this problem with a procedural approach that is generic, fully automatic
  and independent from motion capture data. The main contribution of this paper is
  a point-mass-model-based method to synthesize Center Of Mass trajectories. These
  trajectories are then used to generate the whole-body motion of the character. The
  use of a point mass model often results in physically inconsistent motions and joint
  limit violations. We mitigate these issues through the use of a novel formulation
  of the kinematic constraints which allows us to generate a quasi-static Center Of
  Mass trajectory, in a way that is both user-friendly and computationally efficient.
  We also show that the quasi-static constraint can be relaxed to generate motions
  usable for applications of computer graphics (on average 83% of a given trajectory
  remain physically consistent). Our method was integrated in our open-source contact
  planner and tested with different scenarios -some never addressed before-featuring
  legged characters performing non-gaited motions in cluttered environments. The computational
  efficiency of our trajectory generation algorithm (under ten ms to compute one second
  of motion) enables us to synthesize motions in a few seconds, one order of magnitude
  faster than state-of-the-art methods.
