abstract: In this work, we consider the complex control problem of making a monopod
  reach a target with a jump. The monopod can jump in any direction and the terrain
  underneath its foot can be uneven. This is a template of a much larger class of
  problems, which are extremely challenging and computationally expensive to solve
  using standard optimisation-based techniques. Reinforcement Learning (RL) could
  be an interesting alternative, but the application of an end-to-end approach in
  which the controller must learn everything from scratch, is impractical. The solution
  advocated in this paper is to guide the learning process within an RL framework
  by injecting physical knowledge. This expedient brings to widespread benefits, such
  as a drastic reduction of the learning time, and the ability to learn and compensate
  for possible errors in the low-level controller executing the motion. We demonstrate
  the advantage of our approach with respect to both optimization-based and end-to-end
  RL approaches.
