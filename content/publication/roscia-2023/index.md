abstract: For legged robots, aerial motions are the only option to overpass obstacles
  that cannot be circumvented with standard locomotion gaits. In these cases, the
  robot must perform a leap to either jump onto the obstacle or fly over it. However,
  these movements represent a challenge, because, during the flight phase, the Center
  of Mass (CoM) cannot be controlled, and there is limited controllability over the
  orientation of the robot. This paper focuses on the latter issue and proposes an
  Orientation Control System (OCS), consisting of two rotating and actuated masses
  (flywheels or reaction wheels), to gain control authority on the orientation of
  the robot. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the rotational velocity
  if the robot can be adjusted to steer the robot's orientation, even when the robot
  has no contact with the ground. The axes of rotation of the flywheels are designed
  to be incident, leading to a compact orientation control system that is capable
  of controlling both roll and pitch angles, considering the different moments of
  inertia in the two directions. The concept was tested by means of simulations on
  the robot Solo12.
