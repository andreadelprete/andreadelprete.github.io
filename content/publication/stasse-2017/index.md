abstract: Â© 2017 IEEE. The upcoming generation of humanoid robots will have to be
  equipped with state-of-The-Art technical features along with high industrial quality,
  but they should also offer the prospect of effective physical human interaction.
  In this paper we introduce a new humanoid robot capable of interacting with a human
  environment and targeting industrial applications. Limitations are outlined and
  used together with the feedback from the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and other teams
  leading the field in creating new humanoid robots. The resulting robot is able to
  handle weights of 6 kg with an out-stretched arm, and has powerful motors to carry
  out fast movements. Its kinematics have been specially designed for screwing and
  drilling motions. In order to make interaction with human operators possible, this
  robot is equipped with torque sensors to measure joint effort and high resolution
  encoders to measure both motor and joint positions. The humanoid robotics field
  has reached a stage where robustness and repeatability is the next watershed. We
  believe that this robot has the potential to become a powerful tool for the research
  community to successfully navigate this turning point, as the humanoid robot HRP-2
  was in its own time.
