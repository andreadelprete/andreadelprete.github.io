abstract: We propose a hybrid formulation of the linear inverted pendulum model for
  bipedal locomotion, where the foot switches are triggered based on the center of
  mass position, removing the need for pre-defined footstep timings. Using a concept
  similar to reference spreading, we define nontrivial tracking error coordinates
  induced by our hybrid model. These coordinates enjoy desirable linear flow dynamics
  and rather elegant jump dynamics perturbed by a suitable extended class $mathcal
  K_Ä±nfty$ function of the position error. We stabilize this hybrid error dynamics
  using a saturated feedback controller, selecting its gains by solving a convex optimization
  problem. We prove local asymptotic stability of the tracking error and provide a
  certified estimate of the basin of attraction, comparing it with a numerical estimate
  obtained from the integration of the closed-loop dynamics. Simulations on a full-body
  model of a real robot show the practical applicability of the proposed framework
  and its advantages with respect to a standard model predictive control formulation.
