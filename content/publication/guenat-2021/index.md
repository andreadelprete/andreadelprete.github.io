abstract: Robotics and autonomous systems are reshaping the world, changing healthcare,
  food production and biodiversity management. While they will play a fundamental
  role in delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals, associated opportunities
  and threats are yet to be considered systematically. We report on a horizon scan
  evaluating robotics and autonomous systems impact on all Sustainable Development
  Goals, involving 102 experts from around the world. Robotics and autonomous systems
  are likely to transform how the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved, through
  replacing and supporting human activities, fostering innovation, enhancing remote
  access and improving monitoring. Emerging threats relate to reinforcing inequalities,
  exacerbating environmental change, diverting resources from tried-and-tested solutions
  and reducing freedom and privacy through inadequate governance. Although predicting
  future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on the Sustainable Development
  Goals is difficult, thoroughly examining technological developments early is essential
  to prevent unintended detrimental consequences. Additionally, robotics and autonomous
  systems should be considered explicitly when developing future iterations of the
  Sustainable Development Goals to avoid reversing progress or exacerbating inequalities.
