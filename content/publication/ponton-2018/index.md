abstract: Recently, the centroidal momentum dynamics has received substantial attention
  to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in multi-contact
  scenarios. However, it is also non convex which renders any optimization approach
  difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most trajectory optimization techniques
  to not introduce additional non convexities to the problem. But this can limit the
  versatility of the algorithms. In our previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation
  of the problem that allowed to efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact
  forces. However, our approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective
  which seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced
  by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we propose
  two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints.
  The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically consistent trajectories
  sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime capable. The performance of the
  algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot.
  In particular, we show that the proposed convex relaxation of the original problem
  finds solutions that are consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate
  how timing optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan
  with fixed timing.
